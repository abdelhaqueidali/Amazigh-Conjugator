The Amazigh Verb Conjugator is a web-based tool designed to help users automatically conjugate verbs in the Amazigh (Berber) language. Instead of manually looking up conjugations in tables, you simply enter the verb's base forms in four provided fields (corresponding to different tense/aspect stems: Urmir, Usmid, Usmid Anabaw, and Arusmid), and the tool generates the complete conjugation table. It shows the conjugations for all six pronouns (both masculine and feminine forms) across several key tenses: Urmir, Usmid, Usmid Anabaw, Arusmid, Anad, and Anad Ussid. Crucially, the tool handles some of the complex morphophonological changes that occur in Amazigh verb conjugation, including prefix and suffix additions, and vowel changes. After conjugating, you can export the results in several formats: a structured JSON file, a plain text file (showing pronoun-conjugation pairs), a text file with one conjugated word per line, and a formatted Excel spreadsheet. The Excel export organizes the data with tenses and pronoun-tense combinations as columns, and a single row containing the base verb forms, with all their conjugations. The tool provides examples of the kind of input you have to use to make the conjugation easier. This is especially valuable for language learners and anyone needing quick and accurate Amazigh verb conjugations.

While helpful for any Amazigh verb conjugation, this tool is especially valuable for verbs missing from the Ircam Amsfti data. Its primary function can be to build a personal Excel-based dictionary of verb conjugations.
