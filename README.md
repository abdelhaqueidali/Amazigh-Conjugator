## English Description

The Amazigh Verb Conjugator is a web-based tool designed to help users automatically conjugate verbs in the Amazigh (Berber) language. Instead of manually looking up conjugations in tables, you simply enter the verb's base forms in four provided fields (corresponding to different tense/aspect stems: Urmir, Usmid, Usmid Anabaw, and Arusmid), and the tool generates the complete conjugation table.

**Features:**

    *   Urmir
    *   Usmid
    *   Usmid Anabaw
    *   Arusmid
    *   Anad
    *   Anad Ussid
*   **Handles Morphophonological Changes:**  Correctly accounts for prefix/suffix additions and vowel changes.
*   **Multiple Export Formats:**
    *   Structured JSON
    *   Plain text (pronoun-conjugation pairs)
    *   Text file (one conjugated word per line)
    *   Formatted Excel spreadsheet (organized by tense and pronoun). Excel format is the best choice, it is well organized and easy to use.
*    **Example**: The tool provide an example containing a verb example to know how to use the tool.
*   **Complements Ircam Amsfti:** Especially useful for conjugating verbs not found in the Ircam Amsfti database.
